This code was written so that I didnt have to manually run through a dozen nozzle desgin calculations. The nozzle style is a De Laval Nozzle chosen for its simplicity and efficiency. For this specific piece of code several of the variables are in place due to the assumption that gaseous oxygen and gasoline will be used as the respective oxidizer and propellant. From this, several other known constants where assumed such as the Pc(combustion chamber pressure) at 500 psi,and Tc (combustion chamber temeperature) at Tc=5862 deg F. For this combination of propellants the specific impulse is known to be Isp,sec=279. "A propulsion system with a higher specific impulse uses the mass of the propellant more efficiently in creating forward thrust." The mixture ration needed to get such an impulse, and the value used in this calcualtion was 2.5 along with a grravitational constant y=1.2 .

This code was written to make the proccess of iterting over large nozzle designs quicker using design calculations that can be referenced in Design of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines by Huzel and Huang.
